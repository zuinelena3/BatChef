Description: This package implements a variety of methods for batch correction 
            in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It incorporates
            quantitative metrics (e.g. Wasserstein distance, Adjusted Rand Index)
            to evaluate their performance. 
            Furthermore, the package assists users in identifying and applying 
            the optimal method for specific datasets.
